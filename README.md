### Overview of the class
In this hands-on class, attendees will learn how to design and develop Burp Suite extensions for a variety of tasks. In a few hours, we work on several plugins to improve manual security testing efforts as well as to create fully-automated security tools. This workshop is based on real-life use cases where the extension capabilities of the tool can be unleashed to improve efficiency and effectiveness of security auditing. As an attendee, you will bring home a full bag of tricks that will take your web security skills to the next level. The class is available in 1-day and 2-days versions.
### Audience
Suitable for both web application security specialists and developers. Attendees are expected to have rudimental understanding of Burp Suite as well as basic object-oriented programming experience. While Burp extensions are developed live in Java, attendees can work on Python or Ruby since all exercises are also provided in those languages.
